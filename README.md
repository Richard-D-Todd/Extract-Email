# Extract-Email
This is my first project. The aim is use the email reciepts for my online grocery shops and analyse my spending. This project will also give me experience in:
* Using Jupyter Notebooks to clean and analyse data.
* Loading data into a database and then querying the data.
* Writing scripts in Python to automate the processing of the email files, before exporting to CSV files and/or to a PostgreSQL.

I will be using Jupyter Notebooks for explore my data, Visual Studio Code to write and edit my Python scripts and PostgreSQL to host a local database.

## Files:
These are the main files in which I will be processing, analysing and exploring my data.
