                        This dashboard is to track my regular groceries shop at ASDA online. The code for this project can be found on my GitHub here.

                        I have also been documenting the development of this project through my website:

                        The dashboard is made of the following views:

                        1. __Orders Overview__
                        Total for each delivery, the total spend per month and the proportion of each delivery that is substituted and unavailable.

                        2. __Order Details__
                        The order details for a selected order, along with the count of substitutions and unavailable items.

                        3. __Spending Overview__
                        The most expensive and common items, along with other insights into spending habits.
